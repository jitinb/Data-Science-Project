# Data-Science-Project
This project work includes performing some basic analysis using Google Colab on datasets selected from https://data.gov.in
and creating the following relevant plots using MatPlotLib:
(a) Scatter plot
(b) Box plot	
(c) Bar or line plot

Implementation: 
The dataset has been taken from https://data.gov.in/. The data set is available to be downloaded from the link https://data.gov.in/resource/all-india-consumer-price-index-ruralurban-upto-november-2021. It contains the measure of Consumer Price Indices (CPI) which changes over time in general level of prices of goods and services acquired by various households for the purpose of consumption and are widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation.

Some of the obseravtions from these plots:
1. We made a Scatter Plot for the rate of Food and beverages and Pan, tobacco and intoxicants in Urban areas across different years for the month of January. The inference from this plot is that the rate of both food and beverages and pan, tobacco and intoxicants have increased over the years. However, we see a significant rise in the price of latter which shows that the consumption of these products have increased significantly over time and govt has imposed high taxes on these items.

2. We made a Line Plot for the rate of Milk and products and fruits in rural areas across different years for the month of December. The inference from this plot is that the rate of milk and products shown a steady rising pattern till the year 2017 when the rate started decreasing for an year and thereafter started increasing slightly from 2018. The rate of fruits also obsevred a similar pattern till the year 2017 after which the rates became stagnant for an year and thereafter again started increasing gradually.

3. Finally we made a bar plot which gives the inference that the  rate of Transport and communication has increased significantly over the years due to increase in the prices of fuel and light.
